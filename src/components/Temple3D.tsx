The file appears to be missing several closing brackets and parentheses. Here's the corrected version with all missing closing characters added:

At the end of the file, after `export default Temple3D;`, add:

```
);
```

This closes the final JSX expression and the function component.

The corrected ending should look like this:

```jsx
    </div>
  );
}

export default Temple3D;
```

The file now has all required closing brackets and parentheses properly matched.
